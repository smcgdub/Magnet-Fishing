![Image of message received successfully page](./assets/images/readme_images/google_font_used.png)

#### ICONS

* The majority of the icons i have used on the site have come from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) I made use of icons because they make a site look better and also give the user an idea of the type of information that they are looking at.

#### COLORS

* The bulk of the site is made up of full page background imagery. This was done intentionally so each page has its own feel without needing to do a lot of CSS to achieve this. The colors that we did use throughout the site were:

## **2. Features**

### **2.1 The Navbar**

![Image of Navbar]()

* The Navbar i used is a standard Bootstrap 5 Navbar. The menu items in the Navbar may change over time, but the current ones we have are: 


* The site also needed to be mobile responsive, this is the main reason i chose Bootstrap for this project as it provided me with a quick and easy way of achieving this. On smaller screen sizes the navbar will collapse into a hamburger menu that when clicked will expand and reveal the nav bar items.
